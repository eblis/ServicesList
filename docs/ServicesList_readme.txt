Services list plugin v.0.0.2.8
Copyright © 2006-2009 Cristian Libotean

This plugin will try to list all services that Miranda knows about. It's not possible to list all available services but
this plugin tries to retrieve as many as possible. Please do not change the file name, it will prevent the plugin from detecting
services. Miranda core services cannot be retrieved :(.
It uses a hack and it's not meant to be active all the time, you should only have it enabled for debugging purposes.
